# RLForSeg

Implementing the algorithms introduced in my master [thesis](https://github.com/paulhfu/sideProject/blob/master/thesis/thesis_text/main_frame.pdf).

Mainly we focus here on the task of instance and panoptic segmentation which we solve using reinforcement learning with no need for ground truth annotations.
